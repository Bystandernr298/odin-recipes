    <p><i>Sourdough Focaccia with tomatoes, olives and thyme</i></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2<sup>1/2</sup> cups high-protein bread flour (such as King Arthur FlourÂ®), divided</li>
        <li>1 cup water, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sourdough starter discard, at room temperature</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>12 pitted olives</li>
        <li>6 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon flaked salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 1/2 cup bread flour, 1/4 cup water, and sourdough discard together with a wooden spoon. Add a little flour to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add starter mixture and allow to rise in a warm area, without direct sunlight, until doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Attach dough hook and begin to mix the starter. Add remaining flour, 3 tablespoons oil, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix in enough of the remaining water until dough pulls from the sides of the bowl and forms a ball; you may not need the full 3/4 cup. Knead dough in the mixer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes. Score and cover with a cloth. Allow to rise in a draft-free place until doubled in volume, at least 2 hours, and up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a shallow 12x16-inch baking pan. Knead dough for 5 minutes. Spread into the pan using your hands. Whisk 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon water together. Sprinkle a little bit over the focaccia. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in height.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Push into the focaccia with your fingertips, leaving indentations about 1 1/2 inches apart. Evenly distribute olives and cherry tomatoes on top, pushing them into the dough. Sprinkle rosemary leaves and flaked salt on top. Sprinkle a little more of the oil-water mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes. Drizzle olive oil on top before serving.</li>
    </ol>
